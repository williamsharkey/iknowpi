# iknowpi
This is a website that is a game and a tool.

# Private
Right now this is a private github club. Just William, Nooreen and JayCross are invited. 

Once this gets incubated I'll make it public and MIT liscensed.

# Goal
Be the easiest way to learn digits of pi

# Live site
Here is the live [site](http://iknowpi.com/ "I KNOW PI").

# Deployment
Deployment is easy, just use git, commit your change to the main branch, and DeployBot is set up to automatically deplot to IKNOWPI.com

Don't worry about breaking things. It is ok if you commit code that has bugs in it and it breaks the live site. Right now it is just about fun.

# (Your Idea here)

If you have an idea, just do it and commit the change.

If you want to do it later, have someone else do it, discuss it, etc, just create an issue.
