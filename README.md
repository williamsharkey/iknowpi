# iknowpi

IKNOWPI is a website that is a game and a tool to memorize pi.

If you turn your speakers on you will hear a note associated with each digit.



# Coding style - simple

Try to keep it simple



# Private until JULY 4th 2016

Right now this is a private club. Just William, Nooreen, Jay C., Albert P. and David D. have been invited so far.

Once this gets incubated we will make it a public github project, and put an MIT liscense on it. The goal of having it private at first is to avoid distractions from the public while it is young.


# Why was I invited to this club?

Because you are awesome.



# Goal
Be the easiest way to learn digits of pi.



# Live site
Here is the live [site](http://iknowpi.com/ "I KNOW PI").



# Deployment
Deployment is easy, just commit your changes to the main branch. It will be automatically deployed to iknowpi.com.

Don't worry about breaking things. We can always roll it back. It is fine if iknowpi.com is broken.

Right now it is just about having fun and building stuff.

Here is the current build status:

# Mobile Ideas

Web app with native feel, https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen

Offline mode like http://stories.flipkart.com/introducing-flipkart-lite/

React to WebGL like Flipboard page does, though it's questionable whether this suggestion is in line with project parameters.




# (Your Idea here)

If you have an idea, feel free to implement it and commit the change.

If you want to do it later, have someone else do it, discuss it, etc, just create an issue.
