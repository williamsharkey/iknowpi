# iknowpi

IKNOW PI is a website that is a game and a tool to memorize pi.

If you turn your speakers on you will hear a note associated with each digit.



# Coding style - MINIMAL, literal, simple & stupid

No precompilers like coffeescript, SASS, or typescript.

No minification

Nothing too clever

Don't include any dependencies

Try not to use JQUERY. See http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ 

Only need to make it work for modern browsers and phones.

No datastore.

No accounts.

No backend.

All client side.

No analytics.

No adds.

No premium - all free.

(If you want to do these things, that is fine, just fork the project after JULY 4th 2016 and do whatever you like)


# Private until JULY 4th 2016

Right now this is a private club. Just William, Nooreen and Jay C. and Albert P. have been invited so far.

Once this gets incubated I'll make it public and MIT liscensed. The goal of having it private at first is to avoid distractions from the public while it is young.

# Why was I invited to this club?

Because you are awesome.



# Goal
Be the easiest way to learn digits of pi.



# Live site
Here is the live [site](http://iknowpi.com/ "I KNOW PI").



# Deployment
Deployment is easy, just use git, commit your change to the main branch, and DeployBot is set up to automatically deplot to IKNOWPI.com

Don't worry about breaking things. We can fix it or roll back. It is ok if you commit code that has bugs in it and it breaks the live site. Right now it is just about fun.

# (Your Idea here)

If you have an idea, just do it and commit the change.

If you want to do it later, have someone else do it, discuss it, etc, just create an issue.
