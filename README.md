# iknowpi

IKNOWPI is a website that is a game and a tool to memorize pi.

If you turn your speakers on you will hear a note associated with each digit.



# Coding style - simple

Try to keep it simple

# Goal
Be the easiest way to learn digits of pi.



# Live site
Here is the live [site](http://iknowpi.com/ "I KNOW PI").



# Deployment
Right now I copy the files via ftp to IKnowPi.com via ftp. I messed around with services that auto deploy via githooks, but they were not very useful or were expensive. Open to looking into it again.


# Mobile Ideas

Web app with native feel, https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen

Offline mode like http://stories.flipkart.com/introducing-flipkart-lite/

React to WebGL like Flipboard page does, though it's questionable whether this suggestion is in line with project parameters.
