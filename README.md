# Mobile Ideas

Web app with native feel, https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen

Offline mode like http://stories.flipkart.com/introducing-flipkart-lite/

React to WebGL like Flipboard page does, though it's questionable whether this suggestion is in line with project parameters.
